##  Data Preprocessing Tips

* Convert categorical features (e.g., Fuel\_Type, Seller\_Type) into numerical using **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding**
* Normalize numerical values (e.g., Present\_Price, Kms\_Driven) for better model performance
* Handle any missing values (if applicable) with imputation strategies

##  Example EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

* Count of cars per fuel type
* Average selling price by brand
* Distribution of car age vs selling price
* Correlation heatmap for numerical features
